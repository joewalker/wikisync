# WikiSync

WikiSync is a Google Docs Add-on which allows you to extract Markdown and simple HTML in order to store the content in a more permanent location.

Google Docs is great for collaboration and basic formatting, but a poor choice for long term storage because the URLs are opaque, the domain is Google's, and the presentation is designed for print (i.e. it's paginated and display isn't templated in any way).

This add-on makes it easy to extract Markdown or simple HTML from a Google Document.
