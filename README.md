# WikiSync

WikiSync is a Google Docs Add-on which allows you to extract Markdown and simple HTML in order to store the content in a more permanent location.

Google Docs is great for collaboration and basic formatting, but a poor choice for long term storage because the URLs are opaque, the domain is Google's, and the presentation is designed for print (i.e. it's paginated and display isn't templated in any way).

This add-on makes it easy to extract Markdown or simple HTML from a Google Document.

## Getting Started

Open a Google Doc from which to extract markup. From the "Add-ons" menu select "Get add-ons ...", then search for "WikiSync".

One installed, to use the addon, under the "Add-ons" menu select "Wiki Sync" and then "Sync Now". You should then be able to select the flavour of markup (HTML / Markdown) and copy the text for a more permanent location.
